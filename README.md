## Process
#### 1. Transform data
- First I change some columns types to `Fixed Decimal Number` especial if it is a sale number such as `North America` and `Europ` sales
- Then I created another query, named it `Game Genre` it is where I focus on the genre. I `split column by Delimiter` because some games might have more than one genre then used `Unpivoted Columns`.
